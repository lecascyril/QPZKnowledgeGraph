# QPZKnowledgeGraph

## Description

Here you can find all the code used to display the knowledge graph (KG) in https://wiki.veriqloud.fr .

## Usage

To use the code, since it's purposed to be displayed in a Wikimedia site, just copy paste the code in the right pages if you have the rights to access them. They are not open to editing to every unknown users.

The pages where the copypasta magic happens can be accessed at https://wiki.veriqloud.fr/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Common.js and https://wiki.veriqloud.fr/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Graph.js

The graph.js is a standalone and can normally be tested on its own.
It concatenate the vis.js library fully, the data used, and the code that personalized the view.

## Roadmap

The goal of the KG is to be maintained and updated as more and more protocols are written in the zoo. It should be as easy as possible to update it so finding a solution to de-concatenate the graph.js into the library, the data and the functions may be a good idea.
